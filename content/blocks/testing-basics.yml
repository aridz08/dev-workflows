    severity: error
    content: |
      Use descriptive test names that explain the expected behavior.
      Follow the pattern: "should [expected behavior] when [condition]".

  - id: testing-arrange-act-assert
    scope: testing
    severity: warning
    content: |
      Structure tests with Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern.
      Separate setup, execution, and verification into distinct
      sections for readability.

  - id: testing-no-implementation-details
    scope: testing
    severity: warning
    content: |
      Test behavior, not implementation details. Avoid asserting
      on internal state, private methods, or specific function calls
      unless testing integration points.

  - id: testing-mock-boundaries
    scope: testing
    severity: warning
    content: |
      Only mock at system boundaries: network requests, databases,
      file system, and third-party services. Do not mock internal
      modules or utility functions.
