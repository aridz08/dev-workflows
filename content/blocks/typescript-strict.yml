    severity: error
    content: |
      Never use `any`. Use `unknown` when the type is truly unknown,
      then narrow with type guards.

  - id: ts-strict-explicit-returns
    scope: conventions
    severity: warning
    content: |
      Always declare explicit return types on exported functions.
      Inferred types are fine for internal/private functions.

  - id: ts-strict-no-enums
    scope: conventions
    severity: warning
    content: |
      Prefer union types over enums.
      Use `as const` objects when you need runtime values.

  - id: ts-strict-no-non-null-assertion
    scope: conventions
    severity: error
    content: |
      Never use non-null assertion (!). Handle null/undefined explicitly
      with optional chaining, nullish coalescing, or type guards.
