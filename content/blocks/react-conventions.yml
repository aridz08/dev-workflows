    severity: error
    content: |
      Follow the Rules of Hooks: only call hooks at the top level,
      never inside conditions or loops. Custom hooks must start
      with "use".

  - id: react-component-naming
    scope: conventions
    severity: error
    content: |
      Use PascalCase for component names and their files.
      Use camelCase for hook files prefixed with "use"
      (e.g. useAuth.ts).

  - id: react-prefer-composition
    scope: conventions
    severity: warning
    content: |
      Prefer composition over prop drilling. Use children,
      render props, or context for shared behavior rather than
      deeply nested prop chains.

  - id: react-no-inline-styles
    scope: conventions
    severity: warning
    content: |
      Avoid inline styles. Use CSS modules, Tailwind classes,
      or styled-components for styling.
