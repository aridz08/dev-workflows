rules:
  - id: tailwind-utility-first
    scope: conventions
    severity: error
    content: |
      Use Tailwind utility classes for all styling. Do not write
      custom CSS unless absolutely necessary (e.g. complex
      animations or third-party overrides).

  - id: tailwind-design-tokens
    scope: conventions
    severity: warning
    content: |
      Use Tailwind's design tokens (spacing, colors, typography)
      from the theme config. Avoid arbitrary values like
      w-[137px]; prefer the closest token.

  - id: tailwind-no-apply
    scope: conventions
    severity: warning
    content: |
      Avoid @apply in CSS files. Extract reusable patterns into
      React components instead of creating CSS abstractions.
